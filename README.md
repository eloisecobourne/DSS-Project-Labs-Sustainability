# **How does a country's development affect their environmental impact?**

## Aims
- Understanding the relationship between a country’s development and its CO2 emissions.
- Determining whether a country's emissions change in reaction to another country's emissions.
-  a country's environmental impact to the impact they should be making based on their levels of our features. Rate them from -5 to 5 based on where they are vs where they should be.
- Determining if the factors are interlinked, for example if GDP increases, will this cause literacy rate to increase?
- Time predictions using our understanding of their relationship.
- Visualisation: A map through time showing carbon emissions with features on each country.
